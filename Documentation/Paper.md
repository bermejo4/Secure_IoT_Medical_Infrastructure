# Development of a Secure Medical IoT Infrastructure:
# Abstract
# 1. Introduction:

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of connecting any device (so long as it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and to other connected devices [1]. The IoT world is mostly made up of systems with low computing power, power consumption, memory and disk space that are deployed in insecure networking environments [2].
