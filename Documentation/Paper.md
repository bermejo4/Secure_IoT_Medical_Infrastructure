# Development of a Secure Medical IoT Infrastructure:
# Abstract
# 1. Introduction:

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of connecting any device (so long as it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and to other connected devices [1]. The IoT world is mostly made up of systems with low computing power, power consumption, memory and disk space that are deployed in insecure networking environments [2] for that reason IoT devices and their infrastructure can be considered vulnerable assets which must be protected using different controls and cybersecurity policies in order to avoid failures, and especially in the health sector, due to, consequences of IoT security failures might cause a direct loss of life [3]. 

An IoT ecosystem is typically composed of embedded devices and sensors, mobile applications, cloud infrastructure, and network communication protocols [4], and in each one of these components must be present the CIA triad (Confidentiality, integrity and availability) that is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The elements of the triad are considered the three most crucial components of security [5].
