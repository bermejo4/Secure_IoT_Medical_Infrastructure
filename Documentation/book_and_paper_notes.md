# Book and Papers notes
## This file shows notes collected during the investigation of IoT cybersecurity

* [book, page 6]: " Consequences of IoT security failures might cause a direct loss of life ".⭐

* [book, page 6]: " The composition of IoT Devices, including safety systems, creates constraints that aren't found in typical IT environments ".

* [book, page 6]: " The economics of IoT manufacturing drive device costs (and therefore components costs) to a minimum, often making security an expensive afterthought"

* [book, page 6]: " Most owners didn't know that they should change their passwords or didn't know how to do so"

* [book, page 6]: " Because IoT security differs from traditional IT security in significant ways, hacking IoT requires different techniques as well."

* [book, pages 6-7]: " An IoT ecosystem is typically composed of embedded devices and sensors, mobile applications, cloud infrastructure, and network communication protocols." ⭐

* [book, page 14]: " Designing and developing IoT devices con force manufacturers to make some difficult trade-offs. "

* [book, page 18]: " The IoT world is mostly made up of systems with low computing power, power consumption, memory and disk space that are deployed in insecure networking environments " ⭐

* [book, page 18]: " Many hardware manufacturers have realized they can easily convert any inexpensive platform, such an Android phone or tablet, a Raspberry Pi, or an Arduino board, into a sophisticated IoT device. "  ⭐

* [book, page 18]: " More functionality than a device needs, increasing the ways an attacker can exploit it."

* [book, page 18]: " IoT devices usually don't have the capacity to run antivirus or antimalware protections. ... don't support common security controls."

* [book, page 18]: " The easiest way to use threat modeling in your security assesment is to follow a framework ... which focuses on identifying weakness in the technology rather than vulnerable assets or possible attackers." 

* [book, page 51]: "You must ensure that security doesn't interfere in a negative way".

* [book, page 73]: " MQTT is a Machine-Machine connectivity protocol. It works on top of the TCP/IP stack but is extremely lightweight because it minimizes messaging using a publish-subscribe architecture." 

* [book, page 74]: " One of the main problems with MQTT is that authentication is optional, and even if it is used, it is unencrypted by default. When credentials are transmitted in cleartext, attackers with a man-in-the-middle position on the network can steal them. ... brokers don't typically limit the number of authentication attempts per client.
